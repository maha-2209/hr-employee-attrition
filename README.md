This project was created as a part of capstone to help HR advisories to detect possible employees who may end up leaving the organization. That data sources from the HRMS which includes the details of all past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years.

The outcome of the project is a classification, where we can able to identify, categorize, or judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
 
This project is built based on machine learning, python, and statistics.
